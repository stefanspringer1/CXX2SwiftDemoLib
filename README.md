# CXX2SwiftDemoLib

This project builds a library file and an according header file so that the library can be used in a C++ project.

You will find the library file and the CXX2SwiftDemoLib-Swift.h header generated by the Swift build under the .build directory.

Swift 5.8 or later is to be used.

Use the following C++ code in your C++ project which calls the Swift function `my_swift_add(a:, b:)`:

```C++
//  main.cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <stdint.h>
#include "CXX2SwiftDemoLib-Swift.h"

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    
    int64_t result = CXX2SwiftDemoLib::my_swift_add(2, 7);
    
    std::cout << "Hello, World! " << result << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

You need:

- Include the C++ interop core headers that ship as are part of the Swift distribution in your C++ project. You should add an include path to your clang compilation that points to something like `<SWIFT_TOOLCHAIN_DIR>/usr/lib/swift/`.
- Include the CXX2SwiftDemoLib-Swift.h header in your C++ project.
- Add the libCXX2SwiftDemoLib.\* libary file to your C++ project (quick solution: place it where the linker can find it, on macOS e.g. `/usr/local/lib` or the build directory).

You might use the following build command when using a development snapshot of the Swift toolchain:

```bash
xcrun --toolchain "Swift Development Snapshot" clang++ main.cpp -lCXX2SwiftDemoLib -o CXX2SwiftDemoApp -v
```

The resulting program CXX2SwiftDemoApp prints the following:

```text
Hello, World! 9
```

Also see the description in the CXX2SwiftDemoLib.swift file.
